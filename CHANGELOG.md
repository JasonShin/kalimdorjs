* **feature:** linear_model/SGDRegressor

## [1.1.1]

_Updates:_

* **enhance:** ensemble/RandomForest

* **enhance:** Datasets APIs are now based on promise

## [1.1.0]

:raised_hands: Minor release to deliver a couple improvements :raised_hands:

In this minor release, it focuses on the first enhancement of existing APIs and delivers new features. As the release contains a feature, GaussianNB, and an enhancement of DecisionTree, we thought a minor release is suitable for it.

_Updates:_

* **feature:** GaussianNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier)
  -- What is Naive Bayes? Please check out https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-for-machine-learning/
* **enhancement:** DecisionTree
  -- Fixed the way that the DecisionTree returns the prediction results
  -- Instead of returning all the possible Leafs, it will return the most occurred target Leaf according to a voting process

## [1.0.0]

:baby_chick: hooray! initial release :baby_chick:

In the first release of machinelearn.js,
it aims to deliver the essential models and algorithms required to conduct
the fundamental Machine Learning experiment and development. Some APIs still
might be unstable but they will be improved over time as we receive feedback
from people. You will be seeing new patches being delivered constantly to make gradual
improvements until the library reaches a certain level of maturity.
